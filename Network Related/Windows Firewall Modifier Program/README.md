1) Able to create firewall rule
2) Only create "INBOUND" cuz im lazy to make it as an option
3) If you monitor the changes in the "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security", you need to refresh it whenever you make any changes. (I have been suffered from this whenever I want to see if the code actually working or not)
